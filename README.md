# Medical Insurance Cost Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes medical insurance charges to identify key cost drivers and high-risk customer segments using Python and Power BI.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand factors influencing medical insurance charges
- Analyze impact of smoking, age, BMI, and gender on costs
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for business insights

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Medical Insurance Charges Dataset
- Records: 1,338 policyholders
- Features:
  - Age
  - Sex
  - BMI
  - Children
  - Smoker
  - Region
  - Charges

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Power BI
- DAX
- Google Colab

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering (Age groups, BMI categories)
- Statistical testing (T-test)
- Correlation analysis
- Cost driver identification

## 📈 Dashboard KPIs
- Average Medical Charges
- Average Charges (Smokers vs Non-Smokers)
- % Smokers

## 🖼 Power BI Dashboard

## 💡 Key Insights
- Smokers incur 3–4x higher medical costs than non-smokers
- Obese smokers represent the highest risk group
- Age increases costs gradually; smoking causes exponential increase
- Region has minimal impact on insurance charges

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Predictive modeling for insurance charges
- Time-series analysis (if data available)
- Deployment using Streamlit
